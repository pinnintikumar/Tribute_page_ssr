            <h4>Koduri Srisaila Sri Rajamouli</h4>
            <p> &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;born 10 October 1973 is an Indian film director and screenwriter who primarily works in Telugu cinema.He is the highest paid director in India,and is known for his action, fantasy, and epic genre films
                Rajamouli was educated in Kovvur till fourth standard and then shifted to Eluru where he studied till Intermediate 1st Year. He then took a break of two years and finished his Intermediate 2nd Year in Kovvur. After that, he did not pursue any further formal education.Rajamouli was passionate about storytelling right from his second standard. When he was seven years old, his grandmother introduced him to the epics Ramayana, Mahabharata, and Bhagavata. At the same age, his father introduced him to Amar Chitra Katha comics that featured stories on Indian historical figures, religious legends, and folktales. It had a huge impact on him and developed his penchant for larger-than-life characters. He would remember those stories and the films he watched and then re-tell them to his friends in his own way. His mother was keen on him learning English and would take him to watch English-language films in the nearby towns. She encouraged him to read comics and storybooks in his free time and never pressurised him in his academics.His father recollects about Rajamouli's childhood, "He was not an ambitious child. For a long time, we did not know what interested him. He showed some inclination towards films. He played the role of young Krishna in a film I directed."
